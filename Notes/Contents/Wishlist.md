# Wishlist

Wishlist of major items that would facilitate the development of add-ins for Office 365.

## Tools

A wizard for building the manifest.

A wizard for configuring `webpack.config.js`.

A wizard for creating icon images that conform to the [guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/design/add-in-icons-monoline) for Office 365 add-ins.

Better support for [debugging](../Issues/Debugging.md) add-ins.

Better support for [using Angular](../Issues/Tools.md##Yeoman-Office-Generator) in a project created with the Yeoman Office generator.

Improvements in existing tools that resolve some of the [problems](../Issues/Tools.md) that arise in their use.

## Add-in architecture

[Wider taskpanes](../Issues/Appearance.md).

A means of [sharing state or communication](../Issues/Architecture.md) between the code behind (multiple) task panes and ribbon controls.

Additional [manifest](../Issues/Manifest.md) capabilities that would allow checkboxes, radio buttons, separators, and inactive elements in menus and on the ribbon.

## Add-in deployment

A simpler means of monetizing an Office 365 add-in.  Microsoft appears to be replacing its former pricing and purchase model on [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-US/) by a more elaborate [software-as-a-service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/store/monetize-addins-through-microsoft-commercial-marketplace) model that is better suited for larger organizations than for smaller independent developers.
