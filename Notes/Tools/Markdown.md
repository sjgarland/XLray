# Notes on Markdown

Markdown is GitHub's mark-up language of choice.  To view a Markdown document in Visual Studio, right-click the tab for the `.md` document and select Open Preview.

Since Visual Studio does not provide any means for printing documents, it is necessary to use a separate Markdown tool to generate hardcopy.  [Typora](https://www.typora.io) is one such tool.  It is currently in beta test and available for free.

Other Markdown tools include [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com), [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app), and [Marked](https://marked2app.com), some of which are in the [Setapp bundle](https://setapp.com).
