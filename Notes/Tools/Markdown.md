# Notes on Markdown

Markdown is GitHub's mark-up language of choice.  To view a Markdown document in Visual Studio, right-click the tab for the `.md` document and select `Open Preview`.

## Issues with Markdown

Browsers do not provide native support for viewing Markdown documents.  A separate Markdown tool is needed to convert Markdown documents into HTML.  [Typora](https://www.typora.io) is one such tool.  It is currently in beta test and available for free.  Other tools include [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com), [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app), and [Marked](https://marked2app.com), some of which are in the [Setapp bundle](https://setapp.com).

Line breaks can cause problems in Markdown documents.  Some tools replace them by spaces when converting Markdown to HTML.  These tools will retain the line break if a line ends with two (invisible) spaces.
