# Issues with the Javascript APIs for Excel and Office

The JavaScript API for Excel lacks properties and methods that exist in the C# API.  In particular, it lacks the property `application.ScreenUpdating` that enables screen updating to be turned off and and then back on.  Instead, it has only a method `application.suspendScreenUpdatingUntilNextSync`.  This method does not suffice if the add-in wishes to use Excel to evaluate formulas without causing visible side-effects (e.g., changing graphs and charts that depend on the cell in which the formulas are evaluated).

The `onSettingsChanged` event in the `Excel.SettingCollection` class [does not appear to work](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45247447/how-to-register-handler-for-settingschanged-event-in-office-web-add-ins).  Microsoft's [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/office/office.settingschangedeventargs?view=excel-js-online) notes that "Your add-in's code can register a handler for the settingsChanged event when the add-in is running with any Excel client, but the event will fire only when the add-in is loaded with a spreadsheet that is opened in Excel on the web, and more than one user is editing the spreadsheet (coauthoring). Therefore, effectively the settingsChanged event is supported only in Excel on the web in coauthoring scenarios."
