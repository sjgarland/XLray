# How to Develop Excel Add-ins

The code produced by the [Yo Office generator](https://github.com/OfficeDev/generator-office) for the Angular/TypeScript framework has problems that prevent successful deployment.  These notes describe these problems and how tp fix them.  These fixes are illustrated in the Yeoman Guide add-in.

## Problems

**Problem:** The add-in's icon does not appear during sideloading (from the _Insert_ ribbon).  It appears with the _Show Taskpane_ button on Excel's _Home_ ribbon when using _npm run start_ to run Excel, but not when starting Excel and sideloading the manifest _yeomanguide.xml_.

**Fix:** Add an entry to the _CopyWebpackPlugin_ in _webpack.config.js_ to include the _assets_ directory in the production build (renamed in Yeoman Guide to the _images_ directory).

**Problem:** The Angular _*ngFor_ directive is recognized when using _npm run start_, but not when running a production build.  The console log for the task pane displays the error messages

    Can't bind to 'ngforOf' since it isn't a known property of 'li'.

    Property binding ngforOf not used by any directive on an embedded template. Make sure that the property name is spelled correctly and all directives are listed in the "@NgModule.declarations".

**Fix:** (1) Include _CommonModule_ in _@NgModule.declarations_ in _app.module.ts_.  Import it in _app.component.ts_.  Do the same in any other component that uses Angular directives.  (2) Import _BrowserModule_ in _taskpane.ts_.  (3) Replace _use: "html-loader"_ in _webpack.config.js_ by the following.

          use: [
            {
              loader: "html-loader",
              options: { minimize: false }
            }
          ]
  
Explicit inclusion of other [Angular modules](https://angular.io/guide/frequent-ngmodules) is needed to support the use of Angular forms and routing.

## Customizations

In addition to fixes for the problems noted above, the following customizations are recommended when developing an add-in using the code generated by Yo Office.

### manifest.xml

Generate a new _&lt;Id&gt;_.  Change the provider and display names, description, AppDomain, amd GetStarted strings.

Make a copy of the manifest in which all occurrences of <https://localhost:3000> are replaced by the URL for a directory containing the production code generated in the folder _dist_ by _npm run build_.

For Yeoman Guide, the folder _dist_ was uploaded to _stageonesoftware.com_ and renamed to _YeomanGuide_.  The manifest _Yeoman Guide.xml_ uses the URL <https://stageonesoftware.com/YeomanGuide/dist> instead of <https://localhost:3000>.

### package.json

Change the name and repository URL.

### taskpane.html

Change the title and the sideload message.

### app.component.ts

Change the code in the _run_ method.  If the _run_ method generates content for the task pane, create a constructor that calls _run_ to generate that content before the task pane is displayed.

### app.component.html

Replace the content.  

### assets

Replace _icon-16.png_, _icon-32.png_, and _icon-80.png_ by new icons.  Add _icon-64.png_ for use under Mac OS X.  Delete _logo_filled.png_.

## Puzzles

Why doesn't _templateUrl_ work inside _@Component_ in _app.component.ts_ and _test.component.ts_?  Why must these files _require_ a template instead?

Can the Angular CLI be installed and used to generate components and services?

Can the "Got it" pop-up, which occurs when the add-in is loaded, be eliminated?

Can the _i_ button in the task pane be eliminated?  Clicking it pops up a _personality menu_ with items primarily useful for debugging.
