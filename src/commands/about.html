  <h1>About XLray</h1>
  
  <p>
  XLray exposes and documents problems in developing add-ins for Office 365 Excel.
  It is based on the Angular/Typescript template provided by the Yeoman Office generator.
  </p><p>
  XLray is an open source project created by Stage One Software, the developers of the Formula Forge
  add-in for Excel 2010.  Stage One is currently re-implementing Formula Forge for use with
  Microsoft 365 Excel.    It has already converted 13,000 lines of code written with C#, WPF, and
  XAML to TypeScript, Angular, HTML, and CSS, and it is now adjusting the user interface to conform
  to constraints imposed by Microsoft 365.
  </p><p>
  The project repository contains extensive notes about XLray and problems that arise in developing
  add-ins for Microsoft 365.  Click the Help button on the XLray tab for more information.
