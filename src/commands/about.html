  <h1>About XLray</h1>
  
  <p>
  XLray exposes and documents problems in developing add-ins for Office 365 Excel.
  It is based on the Angular/Typescript template provided by the Yeoman Office generator.
  </p><p>
  XLray is an open source project created by Stage One Software, the developers of the Formula Forge
  and Formula View add-ins for Excel 2010.  Stage One is currently re-implementing these add-ins
  for use with Office 365.

  The project repository contains extensive notes about XLray and problems that arise in developing
