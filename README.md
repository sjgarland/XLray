# Yeoman Guide

Yeoman Guide demonstrates how to use the [Yeoman Office generator](https://github.com/OfficeDev/generator-office) successfully to develop and deploy add-ins for Microsoft 365 Excel.  In particular, it shows how to overcome problems with Angular/Typescript prototypes produced by the generator.

Yeoman Guide is an open source project created by [Stage One Software](https://stageonesoftware.com), the developers of the [Formula Forge](https://formulaforge.com) add-in for Excel.  The project repository contains extensive [notes](Notes/TOC.md) about using Yeoman.
